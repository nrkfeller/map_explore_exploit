    "##MAP\n",
    "First step, optimization process to carry out stratified uniformy-random sampling of the solution space. Uniform sampling along one direction, then again along the next dimension and so on, until we have a sample on all dimension of the candidate solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second step, decide on approximate fitness calculation of the first set of samples. what part of the solution space deserves what quantity of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third Step, every time we generate a new sample, we find the closest pole and decrement the maximum amount of neighborhood samples (by one). Distance should be measured using normalized city block formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Explore & Exploit\n",
    "Mixing of tabu search and simulated annealing. Keep a list of forbidden position, list has LIFO structure, with length based on sample size. Simulated annealing has cooling factor based on the range of the sample space. This is a function of the input values to allow plug and play.\n",

    "    This is done by mutation, mutation size is how far the randomness can range, basically a normal distribution type standard deviation.\n",

    "3. Compute the transition probability. Probability that a point will transision to another point. Based on distance and fitness. Use tabu list and simulated cooling\n",

    "4. Let the new point be the complement with the highest TP - transition probability.\n",
